Overview
========

This repository contains open hardware design files for Antmicro's flexible PCB designed to interface Allied Vision's `ALVIUM series  <https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/embedded-vision-cameras.html>`_ embedded vision cameras featuring MIPI CSI-2 with a range of hardware platforms by Antmicro.
The design files were prepared in KiCad. There is a number of variants of the adapter provided as separate KiCad projects. Those variants differ in length and orientation of pin '1'.

Repository structure
